A lightweight and practical PHP utility library that offers a collection of commonly used helper functions for files, strings, arrays, and HTTP requests‚Äîdesigned to streamline development and support everyday PHP projects.

> üå± Many of these implementations are conceptually simple, but rewriting them repeatedly across projects can become quite tedious.
> To make things easier, I gathered these utilities in one place to avoid reinventing the wheel ‚Äî saving both time and effort.

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require hejunjie/utils
```

## Purpose & Motivation

This is a typical "Developer's Time-Saving Toolkit."
In everyday projects, you may often find yourself dealing with situations like:

Rewriting array operations over and over again;

- Searching StackOverflow every time you need to format file sizes;
- Copy-pasting checks to determine if a string is JSON, a phone number, or an email address;
- Having to refactor your utility classes whenever the project changes...

So, I‚Äôve compiled these simple and frequently-used methods into this toolkit. It‚Äôs not about complexity or fancy features; the goal is to keep it simple, easy to use, and save you time and effort.
